# Welcome to Intro to Python Workshops

### Setup Guide

#### Using Google Colab (Recommended)

To make learing Python as simple as possible, we have centred our course around the use of Google Colab, a free, interactive cloud environment for Python programming. You can get setup with Colab by visiting [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/) or searching for Google Colab (using Google Chrome, as this has the best compatibility, unsurprisingly). Sign up using a Google account and get started by going to `File > New Python Notebook`. 

All of our exercise and solution sheets also have links to open them in Colab. Once you are finished with your work, save these to your own drive using `File > Save a Copy in Drive`.

### Notebooks
During the session we will go through the fundamental aspects of programming in Python. Below you can find the notebooks which we will use and some extra exercises for practice and some fun!:
